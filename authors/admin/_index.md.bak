I'm a final year master student at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> with 4+ years of experience working in Natural Language Processing.<br>
<br>
My most recent projects are focused on <u>Knowledge Graph Reasoning</u> for Question Answering and Graph Completion; <u>Retrieval models</u> for knowledge bases and tables; and <u>Biomedical Applications of NLP</u> with research publications in leading conference such as AAAI, NAACL and ICML. At UMass Amherst, I primarily worked with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Prof. Andrew Mccallum</a> and <a href="https://rajarshd.github.io/">Rajarshi Das</a> at Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/people">(IESL)</a>.
I also interned with the Knowledge Induction Group at <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7140">IBM Research AI</a> under the mentorship of <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-mrglass">Michael Glass</a> and <a href = "https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-gliozzo"> Alfio Gloizzo</a>. Moreover, I have also worked with researchers at GE Healthcare and Walmart while receiving my MS in Computer Science.<br>
<br>
Before starting my masters, I finished my undergraduate at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a> in India. Just after my undergraduate, I worked at <a href="https://www.zs.com/">ZS Associates</a> as a Data Scientist for 2 years where I focused on Biomedical problems such as disease progression modeling, sales targeting and clinical trial optimizations.</div>
